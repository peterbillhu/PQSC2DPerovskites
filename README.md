## Mathematical formulation

For a given topological filtration $\emptyset \subseteq X_1 \subseteq X_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n$, $A \subseteq X$, and $\sim_A$ an equivalence relation on $A$, one can view $\sim_A$ is an equivalence relation on each $X_i$. Actually, for each space $X_i$ one can define it as the least equivalence relation generated by the $\sim_A$, which is again denoted as $\sim_A$ by abusing the notations. 

Furthermore, based on the equivalence relation $\sim_A$ each $X_i$ admits the quotient space $X_i/\sim_A$. By the universal property of quotient spaces, the original filtration $\emptyset \subseteq X_1 \subseteq X_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n$ induces the following filtration of quotient spaces:

$$\emptyset \subseteq X_1/\sim_A \subseteq X_2/\sim_A \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n/\sim_A,$$

where the inclusion relations are based on the canonical one-to-one and continuous map $X_i/\sim_A \hookrightarrow X_{i+1}/\sim_A$ with $[x] \mapsto [x]$.
