## Introduciton

In the field of algebraic topology, the cell complex offers a broader and more versatile description compared to the simplicial complex. Its structure allows for greater flexibility in theoretical arguments, avoiding the rigid face constraints inherent in the simplicial complex [4].

From a data science aspect, persistent homology (PH), based on a continuous deformation of topological spaces, is a novel way to estimate the global and local topology of the based manifold of a given point cloud data [5,6,7] and has been widely applied in many areas of image processing, biomolecule science, machine learning, and deep learning frameworks.

This project proposes a Gudhi-based [1] Python code for constructing and computing the PH of quotient complexes. In the current version, we mainly focus on cell complexes (i.e., quotient complexes (QCs)) built by abstract simplicial complexes and the quotient relation on their vertices (i.e., 0-simplexes). Especially, we also demonstrate the construction of Vietoris--Rips complexes as a filtration and their quotient version. Based on the Gudhi package, the PH of the QC filtration can be calculated easily. The code for more general quotient complexes, such as the quotient relation of higher-dimensional simplices, will be consistently updated in this project.

The primary mathematical framework and released code were contributed by Dr. Kelin Xia[^1] and Dr. Chuan-Shen Hu in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

## Mathematical formulation

For a given topological filtration $\emptyset \subseteq X_1 \subseteq X_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n$, $A \subseteq X$, and $\sim_A$ an equivalence relation on $A$, one can regard $\sim_A$ as an equivalence relation on each $X_i$. Actually, for each space $X_i$ one can define it as the least equivalence relation generated by the $\sim_A$, which is again denoted as $\sim_A$ by abusing the notations. 

Furthermore, based on the equivalence relation $\sim_A$ each $X_i$ admits the quotient space $X_i/\sim_A$. By the universal property of quotient spaces, the original filtration $\emptyset \subseteq X_1 \subseteq X_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n$ induces the following filtration of quotient spaces:

$$\emptyset \subseteq X_1/\sim_A \subseteq X_2/\sim_A \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n/\sim_A,$$

where the inclusion relations are based on the canonical one-to-one and continuous maps $X_i/\sim_A \hookrightarrow X_{i+1}/\sim_A$ with $[x] \mapsto [x]$. Furthermore, the functoriality of homology induces the following persistent homology

$$0 \xrightarrow{} H_q(X_1/\sim_A) \xrightarrow{\psi_1} H_q(X_2/\sim_A) \xrightarrow{\psi_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{\psi_{n-1}} H_q(X_n/\sim_A)$$

of vector spaces over the binary field $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We call it the _q-th persistent homology of the quotient space filtration_ with non-negative integer $q$.

From a computational perspective, this project focuses on the construction of _quotient complex (QC) filtration_ based on a filtration of simplicial complexes 

$$\emptyset \subseteq K_1 \subseteq K_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_n.$$

In particular, we consider $A$ as the vertex set of $K_1$, i.e., the set of $0$-simplices of $K_1$, and define an equivalence relation $\sim_A$ that ``glues'' some points of $A$ together. Based on the equivalence relation, we may define $\overline{K_i} = K_i/ \sim_A$ and obtain the following filtration of cell complexes:

$$\emptyset \subseteq \overline{K_1} \subseteq \overline{K_2} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \overline{K_n}.$$

In this project, we develop a tool based on the Gudhi package [1] to construct and build the QC filtration and its persistent homology.

## Required packages

The core is programmed in Python language with the following TDA packages:

1.  Gudhi [1] (available on https://gudhi.inria.fr/index.html)
2.  Ripser [2] (available on https://ripser.scikit-tda.org/en/latest/)
3.  Persim [3] (available on https://persim.scikit-tda.org/en/latest/reference/index.html)

**Remark** It is important to highlight that the fundamental algorithms and functions developed for this project are exclusively built upon the Gudhi package. Nevertheless, certain tools for plotting and persistence diagram analysis may incorporate Ripser and Persim. Users who are specifically focused on the persistent homology of quotient complexes have the option to remove the code associated with Ripser and Persim.
