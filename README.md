## Introduciton

In the field of algebraic topology, the cell complex offers a broader and more versatile description compared to the simplicial complex. Its structure allows for greater flexibility in theoretical arguments, avoiding the rigid face constraints inherent in the simplicial complex [4].  


## Mathematical formulation

For a given topological filtration $\emptyset \subseteq X_1 \subseteq X_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n$, $A \subseteq X$, and $\sim_A$ an equivalence relation on $A$, one can regard $\sim_A$ as an equivalence relation on each $X_i$. Actually, for each space $X_i$ one can define it as the least equivalence relation generated by the $\sim_A$, which is again denoted as $\sim_A$ by abusing the notations. 

Furthermore, based on the equivalence relation $\sim_A$ each $X_i$ admits the quotient space $X_i/\sim_A$. By the universal property of quotient spaces, the original filtration $\emptyset \subseteq X_1 \subseteq X_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n$ induces the following filtration of quotient spaces:

$$\emptyset \subseteq X_1/\sim_A \subseteq X_2/\sim_A \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n/\sim_A,$$

where the inclusion relations are based on the canonical one-to-one and continuous map $X_i/\sim_A \hookrightarrow X_{i+1}/\sim_A$ with $[x] \mapsto [x]$. Furthermore, the functoriality of homology induces the following persistent homology

$$0 \xrightarrow{} H_q(X_1/\sim_A) \xrightarrow{\psi_1} H_q(X_2/\sim_A) \xrightarrow{\psi_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{\psi_{n-1}} H_q(X_n/\sim_A)$$

of vector spaces over the binary field $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We call it the _q-th persistent homology of the quotient space filtration_.

From a computational perspective, this project focuses on the construction of _quotient complex (QC) filtration_ based on a filtration of simplicial complexes 

$$\emptyset \subseteq K_1 \subseteq K_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_n.$$

In particular, we consider $A$ as the vertex set of $K_1$, i.e., the set of $0$-simplices of $K_1$, and define an equivalence relation $\sim_A$ that ``glues'' some points of $A$ together. Based on the equivalence relation, we may define $\overline{K_i} = K_i/ \sim_A$ and obtain the following filtration of cell complexes:

$$\emptyset \subseteq \overline{K_1} \subseteq \overline{K_2} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \overline{K_n}.$$

In this project, we develop a tool based on the Gudhi package [1] to construct and build the QC filtration and its persistent homology.

## Required packages

The core is programmed in Python language with the following TDA packages:

1.  Gudhi [1] (available on https://gudhi.inria.fr/index.html)
2.  Ripser [2] (available on https://ripser.scikit-tda.org/en/latest/)
3.  Persim [3] (available on https://persim.scikit-tda.org/en/latest/reference/index.html)

**Remark** We note that the core algorithms and functions developed on this project are purely based on the Gudhi package. However, some plotting and persistence diagram analysis tools may involve Ripser and Pesim. For users who are purely interested in the PH of quotient complexes, they can remove the code that involve Ripser and Persim.
